# Lifelog
LifeLog aimed to create an automated, comprehensive, and searchable digital diary of every aspect of a person's life, with the underlying goal of enabling advanced AI systems to understand, predict, and assist individuals based on their entire life history.
The project sought to build a robust digital "life recorder" that could:

Automated Data Capture: Seamlessly and automatically collect a vast array of personal data from diverse sources.
Comprehensive Experience Logging: Log virtually every facet of an individual's existence, including:
Physical Movements: GPS tracking, location history.
Digital Communications: Emails, phone calls, instant messages, web Browse history.
Financial Transactions: Credit card purchases, banking activities.
Media Consumption: Books read, TV programs watched, music listened to.
Sensory Input: Potentially even environmental data or personal observations.
Physical Records: Scans of faxes, postal mail, physical documents.
Structured Knowledge Representation (Ontology-Based): Organize this unstructured, heterogeneous data into a structured, searchable, and semantically rich database. This would allow for logical queries and understanding of relationships within the data.
Accessibility and Retrieval: Provide mechanisms to quickly and efficiently retrieve specific information or patterns from this vast personal database.
Inference and Understanding: Go beyond mere storage to infer higher-level insights such as:
Personal preferences and interests.
Daily routines and habits.
Plans and intentions.
Goals and motivations.
Support for Advanced Applications: The ultimate vision was to enable a new generation of intelligent systems, including:
Hyper-personalized digital assistants with perfect recall.
Enhanced memory aids.
Advanced training systems.
Tools for behavioral analysis or pattern recognition.
